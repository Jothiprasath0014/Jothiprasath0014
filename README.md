## ⚡ Fun Fact
I once participated in a hackathon where the main challenge was to code using only one hand.


## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

1. **Ethanol Detection in Automobiles**
   - **Description:** This project aimed to combat alcohol-impaired driving by developing a robust system using a threshold-based algorithm to detect ethanol levels in vehicle cabins. The primary objective was to reduce accidents and promote responsible driving behavior. Key components included integrating a reliable ethanol sensor for 
accurate measurements, employing a microcontroller (ESP8266) for real-time data processing, and implementing safety measures to deter drunk driving. An optional MQTT Messaging Broker was also developed to send alerts to users or vehicle owners, enhancing overall road safety and accident prevention efforts.
   - **Technologies Used:**
   1. Arduino IDE
   2. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
   3. MQTT Broker Services (Mosquitto)
